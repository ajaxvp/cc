For parse tests (at least), the name format of each test goes as follows:
    <chapter>.<section>_<part of section>_<test no.>_<'a' | 'r'>

<chapter> is the chapter of the ISO standard
<section> is the section of the ISO standard
<part of section> is the number in parenthesis in the section
<test no.> is an identifier for the given test within the location of the ISO standard given by the first three pieces
<'a' | 'd'> represents 'a' for 'accept' and 'r' for 'reject' based on whether the parser should accept or reject the translation unit
